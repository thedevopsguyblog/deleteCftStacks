# Delete Stack

Using Lambda and EventBridge , delete all cft stacks matching a pattern.

TODO:

- Check and recheck if the stacks have been deleted using exponential backof.
- Build an alerting/reporting feature.
- Might need to move to a state machine.
- Jest testing needs a little more work too.
